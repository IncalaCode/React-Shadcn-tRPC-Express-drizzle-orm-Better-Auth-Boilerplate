// Export all controllers from a central location
// This file can be used to export controller classes when they are created

// Example:
// export { UserController } from "./user.controller";
// export { AuthController } from "./auth.controller";

// For now, this file serves as a placeholder for future controllers
// In this architecture, we primarily use tRPC procedures instead of traditional controllers
