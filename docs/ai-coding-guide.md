# ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development Guide

This guide teaches you how to work effectively with AI assistants (like Claude, GPT, or Copilot) when developing with this React + tRPC + Express + TypeORM + Better Auth boilerplate.

## üéØ **Why AI-Assisted Development?**

- **üöÄ Faster Development** - Generate boilerplate code quickly
- **üîç Better Debugging** - AI can spot patterns and suggest fixes
- **üìö Learning Tool** - Understand patterns and best practices
- **üîÑ Code Consistency** - Maintain uniform coding standards

## üèóÔ∏è **Understanding the Architecture**

### **Key Concepts for AI**
When working with AI, explain these concepts clearly:

```
Frontend (React) ‚Üê‚Üí Better Auth Client ‚Üê‚Üí Better Auth Server ‚Üê‚Üí Express.js ‚Üê‚Üí TypeORM ‚Üê‚Üí Database
     ‚Üë                    ‚Üë                    ‚Üë                    ‚Üë           ‚Üë
  TypeScript          TypeScript           TypeScript          TypeScript   TypeScript
```

**Important**: The entire stack is TypeScript with **end-to-end type safety** and **Better Auth** for authentication!

### **File Structure Patterns**
```
backend/src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trpc/              # tRPC setup and routers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/          # TypeORM entities and connections
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/              # Better Auth configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/        # Express middleware (auth, validation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/          # Business logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/             # Helper functions

frontend/src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/        # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/             # Route components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/           # Page layouts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts/          # React contexts (auth, tRPC)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/               # Utilities and configurations

```

## üîß **AI Coding Workflows**

### **Workflow 1: Feature Development**

1. **Plan with AI**
   ```
   "Help me plan the [feature name] for my app. What components, 
   database changes, and API endpoints will I need?"
   ```

2. **Generate Database Entity**
   ```
   "Create a TypeORM entity for [entity name] with these fields: [list fields]. 
   Include proper decorators, validation, and relationships."
   ```

3. **Create tRPC Procedures**
   ```
   "Create tRPC procedures for [entity name] CRUD operations. 
   Follow the pattern from the existing routers."
   ```

4. **Build React Components**
   ```
   "Create React components for [feature name]. Use Tailwind CSS 
   and follow the existing component patterns."
   ```

5. **Integrate Everything**
   ```
   "Help me integrate the [feature name] into my app. 
   Update routing, navigation, and state management."
   ```

### **Workflow 2: Bug Fixing**

1. **Describe the Problem**
   ```
   "I'm experiencing [describe issue]. Here's what I've tried: [list attempts]. 
   What could be causing this?"
   ```

2. **Get Debugging Steps**
   ```
   "What debugging steps should I take to isolate this issue? 
   What logs should I check?"
   ```

3. **Code Review**
   ```
   "Can you review this code for potential issues? 
   [Paste problematic code]"
   ```

4. **Implement Fix**
   ```
   "Based on the issue, can you suggest a fix? 
   Please explain why this solution works."
   ```

## üìö **Code Generation Patterns**

### **TypeORM Entity Pattern**
```typescript
// AI should follow this pattern:
@Entity('table_name')
@Index(['field'], { unique: true })
export class EntityName {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
  id: string;

  @Column({ type: 'varchar', length: 255 })
  name: string;

  @CreateDateColumn()
  createdAt: Date;

  @UpdateDateColumn()
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### **tRPC Procedure Pattern**
```typescript
// AI should follow this pattern:
export const entityRouter = router({
  create: protectedProcedure
    .input(createSchema)
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Implementation
    }),
    
  list: publicProcedure
    .input(paginationSchema)
    .query(async ({ input }) => {
      // Implementation
    }),
});
```

### **React Component Pattern**
```typescript
// AI should follow this pattern:
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface
}

export const ComponentName: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ 
  // Destructured props 
}) => {
  // Hooks and state
  
  // Event handlers
  
  return (
    <div className="component-styles">
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **Better Auth Integration Pattern**
```typescript
// AI should understand Better Auth patterns:
// Backend: auth/config.ts for Better Auth configuration
// Frontend: lib/auth.ts for Better Auth client
// Entities: User, Session, Account, Verification for TypeORM
```

## üö® **Common AI Pitfalls & Solutions**

### **Pitfall 1: Ignoring Type Safety**
**Problem**: AI generates code without proper TypeScript types
**Solution**: Always ask for complete type definitions

```
"Please include complete TypeScript types for all functions, 
parameters, and return values."
```

### **Pitfall 2: Breaking Existing Patterns**
**Problem**: AI creates inconsistent code that doesn't match the codebase
**Solution**: Reference existing code

```
"Follow the exact same pattern used in [existing file]. 
Use the same naming conventions, structure, and style."
```

### **Pitfall 3: Missing Error Handling**
**Problem**: AI generates code without proper error handling
**Solution**: Explicitly request error handling

```
"Please include proper error handling, validation, 
and user feedback for all operations."
```

### **Pitfall 4: Security Oversights**
**Problem**: AI misses security considerations
**Solution**: Ask for security review

```
"Please review this code for security issues, 
especially authentication and authorization."
```

### **Pitfall 5: Ignoring Better Auth Integration**
**Problem**: AI doesn't understand Better Auth patterns
**Solution**: Explicitly mention Better Auth requirements

```
"Remember this app uses Better Auth for authentication. 
Please follow Better Auth patterns and integrate with existing auth flow."
```

## üîç **Debugging with AI**

### **Error Analysis**
```
"Analyze this error message:
[Error message]

What does it mean? What are the most common causes? 
What debugging steps should I take?"
```

### **Code Review**
```
"Review this code for potential issues:
[Code block]

Look for:
- TypeScript errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code quality problems"
```

### **Performance Optimization**
```
"Analyze this code for performance issues:
[Code block]

Suggest optimizations for:
- Database queries
- React rendering
- API calls
- Memory usage"
```

## üéØ **Example AI Sessions**

### **Session 1: Adding User Profile Feature**
```
User: "I want to add a user profile feature where users can edit their information"

AI: "I'll help you create a user profile feature. Let me break this down:
1. Update the User entity to include profile fields
2. Create tRPC procedures for profile operations
3. Build React components for profile editing
4. Add profile routes to the frontend

Let's start with the database changes..."

User: "Great! Please create the TypeORM entity updates first"

AI: "Here's the updated User entity with profile fields..."
```

### **Session 2: Fixing Authentication Bug**
```
User: "I'm getting 'Unauthorized' errors when trying to access protected routes"

AI: "Let me help debug this. Can you share:
1. The exact error message
2. The route you're trying to access
3. Your Better Auth setup
4. Any relevant code snippets

This will help me identify the issue..."

User: "Here's the error and code..."

AI: "I can see the issue. The problem is in the Better Auth configuration..."
```
